# GeoGrade: Analyze and compare areas based on key livability factors.

## Overview

**GeoGrade** is an open-source initiative that aims to detect and visualize building footprints in satellite images through the use of machine learning and up-to-date web technologies. Drawing inspiration from the Google's Open Buildings Project, the project leverages geospatial intelligence, deep learning, and a simple interactive web interface to make buildings data available for urban planning, research, disaster relief, and socio-economic development.

This project is implemented with:

- **Python** for backend computation, data preprocessing, and ML model integration.
- **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** for dynamic frontend interaction and application logic.
- **CSS** for visual interface styling and data visualization tools.
- **REST APIs** to connect the AI model and frontend, supporting smooth geospatial queries and on-demand building detection.

The objective is to open up access to international building footprint data while providing a modular, scalable platform for governments, NGOs, researchers, and developers alike.

##  Additional Feature

-  **Livability Score:** We assign a distinct score indicating the quality of living in a locality based on various indicators. Some of them are following :
  -  **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Integrated real-time air quality information.
  -  **Literacy Rate & Education Access**
  -  **Cleanliness & Sanitation Metrics**
  -  **Greenness:** Greenery coverage and environment friendliness.
  -  **GDP & Economic Indicators**
  -  **Ease of Access to Facilities** such as healthcare, schools, and transport.
  -  **Place Comparison Tool:** Compare two contrasting places side-by-side on all indicators and metrics.

These functionalities enable users to make informed choices regarding city development, moving, investment, and others.
